Week Recap: Worked with the team to build the functional and non-functional requirements. Conversed with other teams on Wednesday, Sept. 17th, about both ours and their project requirements, we compared ideas and gained feedback on how to clean up our project requirements. Performed personal research, and conversed with my team, on the project specifications, specifically data storage.

Worked with the team to build the architecture diagram and put together the project proposal. On Wednesday, we conversed with other teams about their architecture diagrams, then regrouped and talked about what we liked, what we didn't, and what we wanted to add/expand on.

I was assigned to write the *Project Scope and Usage Scenario* and the *Proposed Solution* (with Salma) in the project proposal. Additionally, the team split up research tasks on the different file type functions.

I took on the Image function, Video function, and getting data from online sources (Google Drive) with Ammaar, and thus spent a few hours researching how we would analyze those file types. I then added the processes to the Architecture Diagram.

I also helped with the *Tech Stack* and the *Requirements, Testing, and Requirement Verification* sections in the project proposal, as well as expanded on the dashboard visualization in the architecture diagram.
