Week recap: Collaborated with the team to brainstorm project concept, usage scenarios, and potential features based on project specification in Monday's class, converted discussion bullet points into list of functional and non functional requirements and printed them for Wednesday's class. Compared list with other groups on Wednesday and modified the final requirements list, created team Kanban board on Github.

Week recap: Brainstormed the system architecture diagram with the team and shared it with other teams on Wednesday. Following that, I focused on expanding the CSV and GitHub functions of the diagram. For the CSV component, I broke down the function into smaller steps, identified the metrics we want to generate, and researched approaches for handling different scenarios (local vs. online files, availability of version history, and complexity of CSV content). 

For the GitHub component, I collaborated with Ammaar to research API endpoints and narrow down the most important repository metrics to include. I also explored different dashboard visualizations we’ll need for both CSV and GitHub data, aligning them with the metrics we identified. Along the way, I learned about Google Drive and OneDrive APIs to understand potential online file integrations.

I worked with Ivona to create the UML use case diagram, collaborated with Ammaar, Ivona, and Salma to draft the use case descriptions, and assisted Timmi and Salma in writing the Project Scope and Proposed Solution to ensure it captured all of our system’s key features. I also added several rows to the "Requirements, Testing, and Requirement Verification" section of the proposal.

## (Week 5) Monday 29th - Sunday 5th September

Week recap: Worked with team on Monday to create DFD level 0 and 1 in class, then finalized some data labeling before printing the DFD for Wednesday's class. Looked through some articles online about how to draw DFDs and what are the differences between the levels to refresh knowledge. Went around swapping and evaluating other team's DFDs with the team on Wednesday and shared my opinion on the findings.
