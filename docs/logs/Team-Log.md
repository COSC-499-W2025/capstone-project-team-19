# Team Log

## (Week 3) Monday 15th - Sunday 21st September

Week recap: The team discussed and worked on creating a list of functional and non-functional requirements. On Wednesday, during class we met with other teams and compared requirements.

Discussion went well with other teams, we found out that there are some features that our team has, while other's not, and vice versa.

Such as other team has trend analysis and onboarding tutorial while our team does not
Our team has a feature where we ask for user's permission, while other team does not.

Details:

### Team 20 – Key Differences

**Functional**

- More detailed file classification (e.g., programming language used, coding language type).
- Analysis runs only on new files, avoiding redundancy.

**Security**

- They do not include user permission requests before accessing local files.

### Team 17 – Key Differences

**Functional**

- Adds visualization features such as trend analysis.
- Shows a file preview before analysis, allowing user approval.

**Non-functional**

- Organized into this category: performance, scalability, reliability, security, maintainability, and privacy.

**New**

- Provides onboarding/tutorial at the start of the app.

### Team 3 – Key Differences

**Functional**

- Generates resume bullet points.
- Provides a timeline visualization.

**Non-functional**

- Uses a modular codebase design.

**Use Case**

- They added HR systems and hiring managers.

Plan for the next cycle: Discussing about team's project proposal and architecture diagram that will be submitted next week

## (Week 4) Monday 22nd - Sunday 28th September

**Week recap:**
The team worked on building the architecture diagram and writing the project proposal. On Wednesday, we conversed with other teams about their architecture diagrams, then regrouped to discuss what we liked, didn't like, and what we wanted to add/expand on in our own diagram. We also finally decided to work on native app instead of web app considering the challenges of learning new things that might be useful for us in the future.

For the project proposal, we divided writing responsibilities among the team. We also split up research tasks for the different file type functions. Team members researched approaches for text (PDF, DOCX), images, videos, audio, csv, and code analysis as well as retrieving data from online sources (Google Drive and Github). We integrated our research into the architecture diagram, and the dashboard visualization was expanded to include them. 


### Differences/Similarities with Other Teams' Architecture Diagrams

**Team 14**

- Included a portfolio builder, we did not
- Connect with github that made us decided to also include in our features
- Plan to leave room for a future web frontend, instead of keeping it as an app

**Team 15**

- Not using a database, keeping everything local
- Not supporting music, audio, or video files (we plan to)

**Team 18**

- Also using Electron to support cross-platform desktop development

Plan for next cycle: 
Build the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) that must be submitted next week
