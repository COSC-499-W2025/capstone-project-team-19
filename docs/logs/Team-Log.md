# Team Log

## (Week 3) Monday 15th - Sunday 21st September

Week recap: The team discussed and worked on creating a list of functional and non-functional requirements. On Wednesday, during class we met with other teams and compared requirements.

Discussion went well with other teams, we found out that there are some features that our team has, while other's not, and vice versa.

Such as other team has trend analysis and onboarding tutorial while our team does not
Our team has a feature where we ask for user's permission, while other team does not.

Plan for the next cycle: Discussing about team's project proposal and architecture diagram that will be submitted next week

## (Week 4) Monday 22nd - Sunday 28th September

### Week recap:

The team worked on building the architecture diagram and writing the project proposal. On Wednesday, we conversed with other teams about their architecture diagrams, then regrouped to discuss what we liked, didn't like, and what we wanted to add/expand on in our own diagram. We also finally decided to work on native app instead of web app considering the challenges of learning new things that might be useful for us in the future.

For the project proposal, we divided writing responsibilities among the team. We also split up research tasks for the different file type functions. Team members researched approaches for text (PDF, DOCX), images, videos, audio, csv, and code analysis as well as retrieving data from online sources (Google Drive and Github). We integrated our research into the architecture diagram, and the dashboard visualization was expanded to include them.

Plan for next cycle: Build the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) that must be submitted next week

## (Week 5) Monday 29th - Sunday 5th October

### Week recap:

The team focused on building the Data Flow Diagram (DFD). On Monday, we collaborated to draft Level 0 and Level 1, aligning on system boundaries, external entities, and the major data stores and flows. We looked at examples and articles online to understand the difference between a Level 0 and Level 1 diagram and consulted the professor on our DFD Level 1 draft in class. The feedback was to break down the different metric functions like we did in the System Architecture diagram and to include separate arrows from the "Categorize File" process to each functions. On Wednesday, we went around in class comparing DFDs with other teams, then regrouped to discuss what we liked, didn't like, and what we wanted to refine or add to our diagrams.

## (Week 6) Monday 6th - Sunday 12th October

### Week recap:

This week, the team focused on moving from design to implementation, refining both the System Architecture Diagram and DFD Level 1 to reflect all updated project requirements and new modules like offline processing. The team also began coding key system features: setting up the local environment, implementing ZIP file parsing, and enhancing it with error handling for unsupported and duplicate files, MIME validation, and detailed logging. Unit tests were added to ensure these features work as intended. Additionally, the team worked on creating and testing the consent form for external service usage, ensuring responses are correctly stored in the database. Everyone reviewed and refined multiple PRs, aligning coding progress with the finalized system design.

## (Week 7) Monday 13th - Sunday 19th October

### Week recap:

This week, the team continued implementation work for Milestone 1, completing several major system features. Timmi added the Pull Request template, fixed a Windows-specific MIME-type detection bug to ensure consistent file recognition across platforms, and completed the integration of ZIP file parsing with metadata storage in the local SQLite database. Salma implemented user-configuration storage, enabling persistent saving of user consent preferences (accepted and rejected for both LLM usage and file parsing). Ivona completed the feature for detecting and identifying the programming language and framework used in uploaded coding projects. Ammaar developed the feature that distinguishes individual projects from collaborative ones, allowing the system to identify when files belong to shared repositories versus solo workspaces for more accurate contribution tracking. Johanes implemented the alternative analysis feature, ensuring that when user data cannot be sent to an external service, the system automatically performs a local analysis to maintain functionality and data privacy. Adara implemented the advanced text function, which analyzes text files using LLM and prints the metrics found to the user.
