## (Week 3) Monday 15th - Sunday 21st September

Week recap: The team discussed and worked on creating a list of functional and non-functional requirements. On Wednesday, during class we met with other teams and compared requirements.

Discussion went well with other teams, we found out that there are some features that our team has, while other's not, and vice versa.

Such as other team has trend analysis and onboarding tutorial while our team does not
Our team has a feature where we ask for user's permission, while other team does not.

Plan for the next cycle: Discussing about team's project proposal and architecture diagram that will be submitted next week

## (Week 4) Monday 22nd - Sunday 28th September

### Week recap:

The team worked on building the architecture diagram and writing the project proposal. On Wednesday, we conversed with other teams about their architecture diagrams, then regrouped to discuss what we liked, didn't like, and what we wanted to add/expand on in our own diagram. We also finally decided to work on native app instead of web app considering the challenges of learning new things that might be useful for us in the future.

For the project proposal, we divided writing responsibilities among the team. We also split up research tasks for the different file type functions. Team members researched approaches for text (PDF, DOCX), images, videos, audio, csv, and code analysis as well as retrieving data from online sources (Google Drive and Github). We integrated our research into the architecture diagram, and the dashboard visualization was expanded to include them.

Plan for next cycle: Build the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) that must be submitted next week

## (Week 5) Monday 29th - Sunday 5th October

### Week recap:

The team focused on building the Data Flow Diagram (DFD). On Monday, we collaborated to draft Level 0 and Level 1, aligning on system boundaries, external entities, and the major data stores and flows. We looked at examples and articles online to understand the difference between a Level 0 and Level 1 diagram and consulted the professor on our DFD Level 1 draft in class. The feedback was to break down the different metric functions like we did in the System Architecture diagram and to include separate arrows from the "Categorize File" process to each functions. On Wednesday, we went around in class comparing DFDs with other teams, then regrouped to discuss what we liked, didn't like, and what we wanted to refine or add to our diagrams.

## (Week 6) Monday 6th - Sunday 12th October

### Week recap:

This week, the team focused on moving from design to implementation, refining both the System Architecture Diagram and DFD Level 1 to reflect all updated project requirements and new modules like offline processing. The team also began coding key system features: setting up the local environment, implementing ZIP file parsing, and enhancing it with error handling for unsupported and duplicate files, MIME validation, and detailed logging. Unit tests were added to ensure these features work as intended. Additionally, the team worked on creating and testing the consent form for external service usage, ensuring responses are correctly stored in the database. Everyone reviewed and refined multiple PRs, aligning coding progress with the finalized system design.

## (Week 7) Monday 13th - Sunday 19th October

### Week recap:

This week, the team continued implementation work for Milestone 1, completing several major system features. Timmi added the Pull Request template, fixed a Windows-specific MIME-type detection bug to ensure consistent file recognition across platforms, and completed the integration of ZIP file parsing with metadata storage in the local SQLite database. Salma implemented user-configuration storage, enabling persistent saving of user consent preferences (accepted and rejected for both LLM usage and file parsing). Ivona completed the feature for detecting and identifying the programming language and framework used in uploaded coding projects. Ammaar developed the feature that distinguishes individual projects from collaborative ones, allowing the system to identify when files belong to shared repositories versus solo workspaces for more accurate contribution tracking. Johanes implemented the alternative analysis feature, ensuring that when user data cannot be sent to an external service, the system automatically performs a local analysis to maintain functionality and data privacy. Adara implemented the advanced text function, which analyzes text files using LLM and prints the metrics found to the user.

## (Week 8) Monday 20th - Sunday 26th October

### Week recap:

This week, the team focused on improving the analysis pipeline, database consistency, and overall user experience. Ammaar implemented a fix ensuring that the program exits cleanly when a user declines consent, and updated the parsing process so that each file now stores its associated project name, making downstream grouping and analysis more reliable. Timmi developed the project-type classification feature, enabling automatic detection of whether a project is code- or text-based and routing it accordingly. She also added a safeguard to prevent duplicate ZIP uploads from being reprocessed in the database. Salma refined the send_to_analysis flow by adding user prompts between individual and collaborative analysis phases, reorganizing functions for clarity, and ensuring a smoother, more modular pipeline. Johanes improved the alternative analysis logic by refining keyword filters, applying POS tagging, and enhancing topic extraction to ensure that only meaningful terms are analyzed during local runs. Ivona refactored the language detection module to align with the new database schema, ensuring accurate identification of languages used in code projects, and added features to detect frameworks of a coding project by identifying the configuration/dependency files in a given project. Adara fixed an issue where ZIP uploads containing only files (and no folders) caused the program to stop, and added an LLM-based code analysis feature that generates resume-style summaries for entire code project by extracting README content, function definitions, and comments across each folder.

Plan for next week:
Next week, the team plans to continue to implement the milestone 1 requirements.
Adara plans to keep implementing the code and text file analysis.
Ammaar will implement deleting the `zip_data` folder after parsing.
Ivona plans to implement better language/framework detection to include more languages and frameworks.
Timmi plans to cotinue implementing more file analysis and to add more duplications checks.
Johanes plans to continue implementing analysis of code.
Salma plans to continue developing the code collaborative analysis for global summaries from all projects (possibly using LLMs), refactor the code, and move on to non-code collaborative analysis.

We're going to meet virtually on Monday to discuss further about our plans.

## (Week 9) Monday 27th October – Sunday 2nd November

### Week recap

The team focused on improving project-level analysis and expanding what data we can work with. Adara refactored both text and code LLM pipelines so each project now produces git-aware metrics, project summaries, and contribution highlights, all organized by project folder. Ammaar added cleanup functionality to delete the extracted ZIP workspace after processing and switched our language detector to Pygments, which lets us support way more programming languages. Ivona set up the Google Drive OAuth flow so users can authorize and pull their cloud documents directly into our analysis pipeline. Johanes built the first version of individual code metrics that work outside the LLM path, giving us consistent baselines even when users don't consent to LLM usage. Salma streamlined the collaborative code analyzer by reusing our language and framework detectors and improving the non-LLM summaries we generate from git history. Timmi implemented the GitHub OAuth handshake so collaborative projects can connect to repositories for better contribution breakdowns later on.

### Plan for the next cycle

- Adara will improve the code LLM flow by handling repos without git data and better README ingestion, plus align text output formatting with the code analyzer.
- Ammaar will start updating the database schema to store metrics and help with the external API data analysis.
- Ivona will keep expanding framework detection coverage and look into contribution metrics from the newly fetched Drive files.
- Johanes will save the new project metrics into the database so they can power future dashboards.
- Salma will iterate on the non-LLM collaborative summaries by adding NLP cleanup and storage based on team feedback.
- Timmi will use the new OAuth flow to pull contribution data from GitHub and continue refactoring the main CLI flow.

## (Week 10) Monday November 3 - Sunday November 9

### Week recap

This week, the team focused on improving how different parts of the system work together and ensuring the analysis pipeline runs smoothly across all file types. We added support for CSV files, linked Google Drive and GitHub data more effectively, and made sure results from both LLM and non-LLM analyses are stored consistently in the database. The main workflow was cleaned up to reduce repetition and make the overall process easier to follow, while user prompts and summaries were refined to produce clearer and more useful outputs. Through code reviews, shared testing, and close collaboration, the team resolved several integration issues and strengthened the overall reliability and flow of the project.

### Plan for the next cycle

The team will focus on linking related modules and improving data connections across the system. The CSV analysis will be connected to text outputs to make dataset results more complete and readable, while CSV metadata extraction will be expanded to support Google Sheets through the Google Drive API. The team will continue improving collaboration analysis by refining Google Drive and GitHub integrations, adding more API calls, and fixing remaining bugs. More tables and metrics will be added to the database (e.g., non-LLM code collaborative results) to make analysis outputs easier to track and reuse. Work will also continue on refining the database structure, cleaning up code, and organizing the repo structure into subfolders and helper files for better readability and maintenance.

## (Week 12) Monday November 17 - Sunday November 23

### Week recap

This week, the team focused on completing the remaining core requirements for Milestone 1, with a stronger emphasis on generating skill oriented outputs for the portfolio and resume. This work was complemented by refactoring pipelines and the database, implementing new features, and carrying out targeted feature optimizations. We implemented text and code activity type detection using filenames for both domains and PR keyword signals for code, and ensured all results are persisted in the database. We also refactored the overall repository structure by introducing clearer subfolders and reorganizing the database layer by splitting db.py into a schema module and table specific query modules. In parallel, we continued implementing storage for key analysis outputs including activity types, skill extraction results, contribution data, and project summaries so the entire analysis pipeline now persists consistently across the system. Collaborative workflows were strengthened by improving file contribution tracking, optimizing Google Drive integration, and enhancing text and code detectors. Overall, this week concentrated on solidifying core infrastructure while expanding functionality to support more accurate and scalable project analysis.

### Plan for the next cycle

Next week, the team will complete the remaining Milestone 1 requirements. The team will focus on finishing the integration between pipelines and database storage, refining project summary retrieval, reducing unnecessary print output, and completing collaborative text-analysis features such as Google Drive metrics and contribution scoring. We also plan to refine the start-menu interface, improve the clarity of resume and portfolio outputs, and address remaining GitHub API edge cases. Continuous PR review and cleanup will support final stabilization for the upcoming milestone.

## (Week 13) Monday November 24 - Sunday November 30

### Week recap
This week, the team focused on refactoring and fixing issues, and updated the start menu. Starting from modifying the menu, to give user options such as, retrieve portfolio, retrieve resume, delete insights, etc. Once all skills and metrics produced, project_summaries table started to be filled with necessary information obtained from analysis worked on the previous weeks. Project_summaries table is used in the retrieval of informations such as portfolio and resume, skills list in chronological order, deletion of projects and resume, producing chronological list of project, project ranking. The issues that are fixed and refactored such as file path handling which is now using the project_name from database, file text sections extractions, adding prompt for user's summary in non llm analysis, framework detection path issue, optimization of google drive analysis and word counting fix. Overall, this week concentrated on using all the project_summaries table information to create the portfolio and resume, fulfilling the milestone requirements, and fixing issues that existed from previous weeks. 

### Plan for the next cycle

we'll do optimization needed to improve the performance, and any changes needed for the deliverables of milestone 1. We'll start working on the presentation, updating readme, and demo video. Starting to plan for milestone 2, and any further plans will be discussed after the presentation.

## (Week 14) Monday December 1 - Sunday December 7

### Week recap
This week, the team focused on fixing bugs and issues, finished the milestone 1 requirement, and working on presentation and deliverables. We also continue the collaborative skill analysis from google drive integration. Our project now have "Verbose" logging mode where user can choose to view debug output or just clean view of analysis. We also refactored the llm code contribution summary so that now LLM only summarize based on the files that user contributed to. We also consider another edge cases for analysis without .git files and no github integration by taking the user's contributed files based on the contribution summary they provided.

We updated the readme files, wbs, DFD, and System Architecture Diagram based on what we have so far in milestone 1. We also recorded the video demo to show how the system works. Github integration issues were also addressed this week. We fixed the github issues counting, and user's review storage. GraphQL API is used in fetching PR's data which improve the performance.

Overall, this week concentrated on fixing issues, working on Milestone 1 Deliverables, and updating readme file.

### Plan for the next cycle

No sprint for next week. Milestone 2 will be reassessed at the beginign of next year.

## (Term 2 Week 1) Monday January 5 - Sunday January 11

### Week recap
This week, after winter break, we continued to implement milestone 2 requirements. Duplicate files detection now reimplemented, by detecting the content of the file, not the filename. The system now can distinguish between completely new projects, exact duplicates, and related projects. We also started implementing the incorporating key role, however, this feature will be discussed further for clarification of what the system should do and produce. We also implemented the feature outputting a text file of resume and portfolio. The system can now export the resume and portfolio into docx file with the layout following the output in terminal. We also implemented a new feature that allows user to receive feedback based on the unmet criteria from skill bucket. For now, the feedback only for the text project. Feedback for code project will be implemented in the next week/next PR. The contribution section in both code and text project now are more detailed, giving information about how much contributions the user has given in a project. We also implemented the rerank project feature, allowing user to rerank project manually not following the order of project score, which will be used to decide which project to be showcased first. We also implemented the new feature where user is given flexibility to choose which projects to be shown in the resume

Overall, this week focused on implementing necessary features needed to fulfill milestone 2 requirements

### Plan for the next cycle

We will continue implementing the milestone 2 requirements, and fix bugs that was found during the implementation this week.

## (Term 2 Week 2) Monday January 12 - Sunday January 18

### Week recap

**Connection to previous week:**  
After completing some of the first few Milestone 2 requirements last week, the team continued to fix some bugs and began wrapping the system as an API service.

### Coding tasks  
The team fixed resume rendering crashes and edge cases in [PR #354](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/354), including correcting the resume creation flow to pass required DB parameters and safely formatting text projects with two-stage activity breakdowns. Resume customization was added in [PR #355](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/355), introducing editable overrides for project summaries, contribution bullets, and display names, with support for resume-only edits versus global overrides that propagate across resumes and portfolio rendering.

To support Milestone 2’s service requirement, the API foundation and documentation were introduced in [PR #357](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/357), including a FastAPI skeleton, conventions, and a services layer to avoid endpoints connecting to the DB directly. Several API endpoints were implemented to expose analyzed data, including project retrieval in [PR #369](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/369), privacy consent GET/POST in [PR #370](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/370), and resume/skills retrieval endpoints in [PR #374](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/374).

Resume exporting was significantly improved in [PR #368](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/368) by restructuring sections to match standard resume formatting, upgrading contribution bullets to be metric-backed, and adding PDF export support. Project thumbnails were added in [PR #372](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/372), enabling add/edit/remove flows, storing images centrally under an `/images` directory, persisting paths in a new table, and integrating thumbnails into portfolio exports. Duplicate detection was strengthened in [PR #363](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/363) via path normalization, better renamed-file handling, and two-tier strict/loose fingerprinting to distinguish exact duplicates from potential new versions.

A key Milestone 2 blocker was addressed by designing the upload flow as a resumable wizard rather than a single request. The first four wizard endpoints plus upload session persistence were implemented in [PR #376](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/376), including a new `uploads` table, state stored in `state_json`, shared DB connection handling, and endpoints for starting uploads, polling status, submitting classifications, and submitting project types for mixed projects.

### Testing or debugging tasks  
The team added and updated unit tests across resume rendering, exporting, and API routes, including endpoint coverage for resumes and skills in [PR #374](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/374). API functionality was also validated through manual Postman testing to confirm correct headers, expected status codes (including 404s for missing projects), and stable wizard state progression in [PR #376](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/376). Resume export changes, including PDF generation, were verified alongside dependency updates in [PR #368](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/368).

### Reviewing or collaboration tasks  
The team aligned on API conventions (services layer, user ID passed via headers, and documentation format) during review of [PR #357](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/357). PR reviews also covered correctness and UX clarity for the duplicate-detection changes in [PR #363](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/363) and the thumbnail/export integration in [PR #372](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/372), ensuring the features remained consistent with existing CLI flows and database behavior.


### Plan for the next cycle

We will continue implementing the milestone 2 requirements, and fix bugs that was found during the implementation this week.

## (Term 2 Week 3) Monday January 19 - Sunday January 25

**Connection to previous week:**  
Building on the previous week’s API skeleton, initial GET endpoints, and the upload wizard backbone, the team focused on making the upload flow correct under real re-uploads (deduplication + versioning), adding authentication for secure API access, expanding resume/portfolio customization and export options, and continuing external integration work (GitHub OAuth).

### Coding tasks  
The team integrated existing CLI deduplication logic directly into the API upload wizard in [PR #391](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/391) to ensure duplicate and near-duplicate projects are handled before classification or project-type steps. This added persisted wizard fields (`dedup_skipped_projects`, `dedup_new_versions`, `dedup_asks`), introduced a new wizard status (`needs_dedup`), and implemented a resolution endpoint (`POST /projects/upload/{upload_id}/dedup/resolve`) so the UI can choose between skip/new project/new version paths without server-side prompting. Based on review feedback about false negatives in small projects, dedup matching was refined in [PR #398](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/398) by shifting from hash-only Jaccard similarity to a combined scoring approach (path + content similarity) with improved prompt context for decision-making.

To secure the API, JWT authentication was implemented in [PR #392](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/392), including username/password support, `/register` and `/login` endpoints, token-based authorization enforced across routes, and updated documentation and environment configuration (`JWT_SECRET`). The team also expanded the API surface for resume workflows by implementing resume generation and editing endpoints in [PR #402](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/402), including automatic fallback behavior (top projects) when no project selection is provided.

Customization work continued by improving the resume contribution editing UX in [PR #393](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/393), allowing users to append new bullets or fully replace contributions. Portfolio customization was added in [PR #394](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/394), enabling portfolio-only vs global overrides for display names, summaries, and contribution bullets with tests validating override precedence. Portfolio exporting was extended with PDF support in [PR #396](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/396), ensuring exported PDFs reflect edited wording and thumbnails and updating export test coverage.

The team also fixed correctness issues in LLM-based code summaries in [PR #401](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/401) by preventing unintended fallback to zip-level READMEs, clarifying prompt behavior when a project README is missing (fallback to code structure/comments), and adding debug traces to make the summary source selection auditable. Finally, GitHub integration endpoints were implemented using OAuth authorization code flow in [PR #403](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/403), adding endpoints for starting OAuth, listing repositories, linking a repo, and handling the callback (`/auth/github/callback`) with updated API documentation.

### Testing or debugging tasks  
The team added and updated targeted test coverage across dedup resolution behavior and scoring changes (including small-project edge cases) in [PR #391](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/391) and [PR #398](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/398). Authentication changes in [PR #392](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/392) were validated through Postman by using Bearer tokens and verifying route protection, and environment setup was updated to require `JWT_SECRET`. Export workflows were verified through new/updated tests for portfolio PDF generation and alignment of DOCX tests in [PR #396](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/396). The LLM summary fixes in [PR #401](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/401) added tests to ensure project summaries and contribution summaries use the correct project-scoped context and focused file selection. GitHub OAuth endpoints and flow behavior were tested with added pytest coverage in [PR #403](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/403).

### Reviewing or collaboration tasks  
The team collaborated on aligning wizard behavior with frontend needs by persisting dedup outcomes in upload state and introducing a clean resolve endpoint in [PR #391](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/391). Review feedback also prompted follow-up improvements for small-project dedup in [PR #398](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/398). The team coordinated on cross-PR dependencies for customization work (noting rebase requirements between [PR #393](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/393) and [PR #394](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/394)) and ensured exported artifacts reflect override precedence and thumbnails. For GitHub OAuth in [PR #403](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/403), the team aligned on expected frontend-driven sequencing and documented setup requirements in the README and `.env.example`.

### Issues or blockers  
A recurring blocker was inconsistent behavior when re-uploading projects through the API, where older uploaded data could influence classification and project-type decisions. This was addressed by running dedup immediately after ZIP parsing in [PR #391](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/391), skipping exact duplicates, renaming confident new versions for consistent downstream naming, and pausing the wizard only when user decisions are required. Another issue was brittleness of hash-only similarity for small projects, which was mitigated by combined similarity scoring and clearer prompts in [PR #398](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/398). API security concerns (no way to verify user identity) were addressed by introducing JWT auth and password-based login in [PR #392](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/392). Incorrect LLM summaries caused by README fallback behavior were addressed by enforcing project-scoped context and adding debug traces in [PR #401](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/401).

### Plan / goals for next week  
Next week, the team will continue completing the remaining upload wizard endpoints and validations, especially around integration sequencing and service-layer safeguards for GitHub linking flows introduced in [PR #403](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/403). Resume generation/edit API behavior from [PR #402](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/402) will be stabilized with additional edge-case testing, and customization/export flows will be finalized once dependent branches are merged and rebased ([PR #393](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/393), [PR #394](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/394), [PR #396](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-19/pull/396)). Further test coverage will be added for dedup resolution paths and authenticated API access to ensure consistent behavior under repeated uploads and multi-resume scenarios.
