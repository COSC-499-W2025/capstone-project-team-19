# Team Log

## (Week 3) Monday 15th - Sunday 21st September

Week recap: The team discussed and worked on creating a list of functional and non-functional requirements. On Wednesday, during class we met with other teams and compared requirements.

Discussion went well with other teams, we found out that there are some features that our team has, while other's not, and vice versa.

Such as other team has trend analysis and onboarding tutorial while our team does not
Our team has a feature where we ask for user's permission, while other team does not.
