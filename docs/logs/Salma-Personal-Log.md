Week Recap:

- Reviewed the professor’s requirements and discussed them with the team during Wednesday’s class.
- Worked on the consent feature: drafted the consent text, implemented logic to store consent responses in the SQLite database, and wrote tests to ensure both accepted and rejected responses are stored correctly.
- Made several adjustments based on feedback e.g. incorporated Ammaar’s suggestion to add the .db file to .gitignore and ensured test data doesn’t pollute the actual user consent database.
- Provided comments and suggestions on pull requests, such as the file output placement in Timmi’s ZIP parsing PR. Also reviewed other PRs, including DFD Level 1 (Ammaar) and WBS (Johanes).

## (Week 7) Monday 13th October - Sunday 19th October

Week recap:

- Worked on implementing user configuration based on username or user_id for future uses. This feature allows users to save and modify their user consent and LLM consent settings. It also handles edge cases, such as when a user is logged in but has not yet set their configuration, or when only a partial configuration is provided. Additionally, I created a local database view (latest_user_consent) for quick lookups of usernames and their most recent consent settings.
- Provided comments and suggestions on multiple PRs. For example, I reviewed Timmi’s PR and suggested storing file metadata based on username or user_id. I also reviewed Johanes’ PR and provided some suggestions for next steps.
