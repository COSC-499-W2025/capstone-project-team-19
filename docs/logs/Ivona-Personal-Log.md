Week Recap:
I was absent from class this week due to health reasons. I provided my professor with a doctor’s note and informed my team of my situation. Because of this, I wasn’t able to contribute earlier in the week, but by Saturday night/Sunday I caught up on all team discussions and reviewed the work completed. I contributed by helping with the UML Use Case Diagram.
