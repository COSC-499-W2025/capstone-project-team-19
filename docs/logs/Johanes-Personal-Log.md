Week recap: Discussed with the team on designing the architecture diagram. Collaborate together and integrate everything in one document of project proposal. Discussed with three other teams as mentioned in team weekly logs, evaluating each other, compared our architecture and reflect on our own diagram. Added and removed some features that we agreed on.

Did a research on text extracting and processing function (both docx and pdf files), added details to text function and dashboard visualization part on architecture diagram, and project proposal.

I was helped by ammaar in adding details to the architecture diagram since I cant access to the figma due to student account verification problem.
