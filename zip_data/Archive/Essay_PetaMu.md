**Introduction**  
As seen in Sustainable Development Goal \#4, the world’s access to quality education still remains as a global multifaceted unrest. Yet, even as more people gain access to quality education around the world, we often forget that *quality remains inextricably linked to quantity*. With about 55 million pupils, 3 million instructors, and 236,000 schools, Indonesia must choose the best and most diverse strategies to enhance educational achievements. A common misconception held by educators and learners in Indonesia is that a nation’s quality education can solely be measured through its curriculum and teaching assets. In reality, while this conception is true to some extent, many people disregard the misallocation of funds and the imbalanced distribution of quality education. Using the 2020 Indonesian government’s spending on the education sector, PetaMu aims to raise equity in education provision across the nation, particularly between rural and urban regions through developing an online mentorship platform.

**Delving Deeper Into the Problem** —Discussion of the Case  
The disparities in quality education between rural and urban areas in Indonesia are caused by the imbalanced distribution of resources. Teachers in rural areas such as in East Indonesia are 17% less likely to have completed four-year degrees than those in urban areas such as in West Indonesia (World Bank 2008). Difference in educators' qualifications implies different abilities to carry out effective pedagogies. This results in students of rural areas performing less well than their urban peers. For example, high school students of Northern Maluku had an average of 42.74 in their Science exam, while high school students of Jakarta had an average of 66.9 (Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, 2019). There is a higher preference of teaching in urban areas due to inadequate facilities in rural areas; resulting in higher ratio of teacher-to-pupil in urban areas, and therefore less attentive support could be provided to each students. To foster the competency of future shapers of the nation, Indonesia must evenly distribute quality education through sufficient facilitation of rural areas and encourage the future generation to become educators. 

**Bringing Visions to Fruition** —Recommendations/ Solutions  
To resolve the aforementioned issues, we propose the **PetaMu project**. PetaMu is an online mentorship platform that provides students in rural areas across Indonesia the opportunities, resources, and guidance, to explore their passion and pursue a passion project of their own. As the world of 21st century education heads towards the development of soft-skills, PetaMu believes that rural areas must match the pace of quality education (curriculum and learning styles) in urban areas, therefore adapting new generations to the current demand of personal and professional skills.   
Our project is heavily inspired by the International Baccalaureate (IB) Curriculum, a globally recognized education curriculum that strives to develop strong academic, social and emotional characteristics among their students. Part of the IB Curriculum assessments is Personal Project (PP), a student-driven project investigating a student’s area of interest in order to create a product.   
There are two key stages to completing the PetaMu project: (1) the Training stage for aspiring Mentors and (2) the Mentoring stage for the students. The first stage is **Training** to become Mentors. In this stage, aspiring educators will learn the principles and methods of mentoring a passion project through a training program with current IB PP teachers. Aspiring Mentors should also choose to specialise in one of the following subjects during this period: General, Languages, Mathematics, Sciences, Arts, and Humanities. High school students, undergraduate students, and graduates ranging from 16-25 years old may partake in this stage. This stage will occur for 4 months. The aspiring educators will then complete an examination to verify their teaching abilities. If they pass the test, they will be certified as Mentors and may proceed to the second stage.  
The second stage is the **Mentoring**. In this stage, Mentors are assigned to clients (students) based on the student’s subject of interest. Then, through these mentoring sessions students will explore, determine, and grow their passion through a series of activities. For example, students will be guided to create their own Personal Project. The Mentoring sessions will occur weekly via Online Conferences and for 6 months. Once the mentors successfully guide students to complete their passion project, they are given the choice to continue participating as a resource person to train future recruited mentors.   
PetaMu will allocate the budget of Rp. 15,800,000,000,000 towards Training, Mentoring, App Development, Operations, Marketing, and Finance purposes. Detailed budget plan is available in Appendix A. Further, PetaMu will collaborate with Tokopedia and Telkomsel for the following deal: (1) For every client purchase, 10% of Telkomsel profits will be donated to PetaMu (2) Tokopedia users and buyers can donate Rp.5.000-100.000 to PetaMu in the effort to transport technological devices to rural areas.

**Conclusion**  
This project tackles two key problems:   
First, to encourage current educators to relocate, we propose an online platform because it offers resources that an average, traditional school requires (textbooks, games for learning, discussion forums). These materials can be accessed with ease by teachers, peers, and students. Certified teachers essentially have alternative options to reach and relocate to underdeveloped areas. Moreover, the funding for learning materials can be shifted to raising the teachers’ wages, and the development and launch of the app. As wages affect the desirability and appeal of teaching positions, new funds can drive an increase in salaries, and therefore, incentivises current and future educators to fill in teaching positions.   
Secondly, although changes in salaries may prove beneficial for anyone interested or studying the educational field, we plan to facilitate collaboration and experiential learning in order to instill and foster the value of education, thus encouraging the future generation to become educators. The online learning model offers space and time to familiarise urban populations to the reality of rural areas; without a connection to rural areas, there is less incentive to empower and mobilise rural development. Additionally, online learning offers teachers and students flexibility and personalization. Flexibility and personalization shifts agency to the teacher and students over their learning preferences and raises and fosters their self-reliance. The model of online learning through one-one mentorship is mutually beneficial for both students and teachers.
