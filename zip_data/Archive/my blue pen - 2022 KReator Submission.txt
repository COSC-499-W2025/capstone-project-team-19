my blue pen


you splattered across the pages
marks on marks of embellishment
underlining some food for thought
for the years onwards, i hope to remember


frankly at times, i’d like to dispose you
for leaving blue bruises on me
though i must admit,
’twas completely my fault.


didn’t remember where your cap was, i
didn’t care to look for it, i
have to churn up the consequences, i
left blue bruises on myself, didn’t i?


oh, did you come back from the store?
a mild amalgam of fig, cigar, and booze
scents dash from your arms to mine,
handing out a fresh box of blue pens


oh, how’d you know i needed new ones?
corners of your lips rose, like
each time i’ve accepted your sorries
oh, but how’d you not know?


that your claws no longer scar me
your ink no longer stain 
your perfume no longer allure my ruptured nose
because the papers are done.
________________
A six-stanza poem responding to the surging cases of domestic violence and the effect of gaslighting in abusive relationships. It is presented as an anecdote of the narrator reflecting on the blue "bruises" or ink marks from her blue pen, which are actually bruises left by her abusive partner. The first half of the poem demonstrates how the narrator does not have the courage nor a support system to directly address and vent the problems of her relationship so she turns every minute moment into very intimate reflections. The second half of the poem hints a change in her fate as it reveals that the entire time she was using the blue pen, the narrator was writing divorce request letters.
